Once this file is downloaded, you will simple create a new folder on your desktop titled "Blackplow."
Drop BPL.exe into this folder, along with any .dll file you wish to inject. 
Once you have everything you need, simple start the application and search for the program name. Not the process name. This does include spaces. 
After, you will be promoted to type the .dll name. This does include the extension as well, so it would like something like: "Example.dll"
Prompt the application with the "ENTER" key, which should close the software and inject the dynamic library link into your software.
