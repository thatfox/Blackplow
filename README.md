**Installation:**

1. Once *"Blackplow-master.zip"* has been downloaded, save the ```.zip``` folder to your desktop.
2. On your desktop, create a folder titled *"Blackplow,"* and then drag the ```.zip``` folder into the newly created folder.  
3. From inside the Blackplow folder, unzip the Blackplow-master.zip folder. From inside the master folder you just unzipped, you will find an application named *"BPL.exe."* Drag this executable out and into the main directory we created (Blackplow main folder). 
4. You can now delete the .zip folder and unzipped version it created --which should now be empty-- as you have placed its contents in the main directory. 
5. You will now be left with a folder layout like this: https://i.ibb.co/sJTTXB0/Screenshot-1.jpg.

**Instructions:**

1. To inject a ```.dll``` file, you will need to provide one of your own. Simply navigate to where your preferred  ```.dll```. is stored, and drag it into the Blackplow folder on your desktop. 
2. The ```.dll``` is inside, it should be in the same folder as the ```.exe```. Now, you can start BPL.exe with admin permissions. 
3. You will be prompted for an *"application name,"* not a process name. Example: https://i.ibb.co/jRMhMML/Screenshot-2.jpg
4. After typing the application name, press your "enter" key. This will prompt you with a second option, which is the name of your dynamic link library (```.dll```) file --which you wish to inject. To inject the ```.dll```, type its name (including the extension) like this: ```Example.dll```, and then press the enter key a second time. 
5. The executable should now close autoamtically, and your dynamic link library file should be injected into the desired process.
